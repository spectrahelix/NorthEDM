# Project features

## FestDash — festival delivery network
Full spec, current state, data model, state machine, and phased build plan live
in [`docs/FESTDASH.md`](docs/FESTDASH.md). In short: festival-goers order from a
vendor set up at their festival, prepay into **escrow**, and a registered
**driver** delivers to their campsite guided by landmark directions + a **live
GPS ping**; delivery is confirmed by a **4-digit code (last 4 of the customer's
phone)**, after which escrowed funds release to the vendor's payout account.
Recommended integrations: **Stripe Connect** (escrow + vendor payouts — note
GoDaddy/Square don't fit this) and **Mapbox** (live map). Read the doc before
working on FestDash.
